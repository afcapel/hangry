Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Wash potatoes, and if desired peel before slicing. Spray an 8 x 8 inch baking dish with non-stick spray. Layer potatoes into baking dish, overlapping each slice over the previous one. When the bottom of the pan is covered, lightly season with salt and pepper. Continue layers until all of the potatoes are in the pan. Pour Swanson's Low Fat Cream Starter over the potatoes. Bake potatoes for about 30 minutes. Sprinkle cheese on potatoes and bake until the cheese is melted. Enjoy!
